## Installation and configuration:

### Get the bundle

Use Tag 5 for Symfony 5, see previous tags and README according to your older version

Add BCCCronManagerBundle:

``` bash
    composer require bcc/cron-manager-bundle v4.2
    bin/console assets:install
```

Adding BCCCronManagerBundle to your application kernel and import the routing configuration is already done by SymfonyFlex

You can customize the prefix as you wish.

Don't forget to secure your route :

``` yml
    access_control:
        - { path: ^/admin, role: ROLE_ADMIN }
```
